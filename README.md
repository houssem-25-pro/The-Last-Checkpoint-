# The-Last-Checkpoint-
I feel ready to take the next step in my career. This Bootcamp has taught me a lot—not just technical skills like [HTML/CSS/Tailwind/Bootstrap/JS/ReactJs/ExpressJs/NodeJs/MongoDB/Git&Github Tools....], but also how to work through challenges and stay confident when things get tough.

I’m proud of how far I’ve come and excited to start applying what I’ve learned in the real world. I’ve definitely grown, and I’m looking forward to what’s next.
